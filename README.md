AI Healthcare Chatbot

This AI-powered healthcare chatbot project is designed to provide preliminary health assessments based on user-inputted symptoms. Utilizing machine learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP), the chatbot predicts possible health conditions, offers descriptions, and suggests precautionary steps. This project is intended for educational purposes and should not replace professional medical advice.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following folders and main files:

1. Folders
Data

dataset.csv: The primary dataset containing symptoms and associated diagnoses, used to train the chatbotâ€™s predictive model.
Training.csv: A subset of dataset.csv, specifically used for training the Decision Tree model.
Testing.csv: A subset for testing the trained model, used to evaluate the accuracy of predictions.
MasterData

Symptom_description.csv: Contains descriptions of each symptom, enabling the chatbot to give users informative details about their conditions.
Symptom_precaution.csv: Lists preventive measures for each symptom or condition to help users manage their health better.
Symptom_Severity.csv: Includes severity levels for symptoms, helping the chatbot assess the seriousness of conditions.
2. Main Code File
chat_bot.py: This Python script contains the code for running the chatbot. It loads data from the CSV files, preprocesses the input, trains a machine learning model, and then interacts with users by accepting symptoms as input and responding with potential diagnoses, descriptions, and precautionary steps.
Features
Symptom Recognition and Matching: The chatbot uses regex-based matching to identify and validate symptoms provided by users.
Decision Tree Model for Diagnosis: Trained on a comprehensive dataset, this model predicts potential diagnoses based on the symptoms.
Severity and Recommendations: The chatbot provides feedback on condition severity and suggests consulting a healthcare provider if necessary.
Text-to-Speech Output: With pyttsx3, the chatbot can vocalize its responses, improving accessibility.
Detailed Symptom Descriptions and Precautions: Descriptions, severity ratings, and preventive measures help users understand their symptoms and take informed actions.

Installation and Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-chatbot.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
cd healthcare-chatbot
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the chatbot:

bash
python chat_bot.py

Note: Make sure you have Python installed and the required libraries, including pandas, pyttsx3, and sklearn.\

Usage
Run chat_bot.py to start the chatbot.
The chatbot will prompt you to enter symptoms. Type in your symptoms to receive diagnostic predictions.
Follow the on-screen prompts for additional information, including symptom severity and preventive measures.
Disclaimer
This chatbot is intended for informational and educational use only. It should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice or diagnosis.
